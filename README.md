# SEVENQTHREE
Starting this pandemic I started using my phone even more, to the point where the first thing I would do as soon as wake up would be to check my phone, and before going to bed I would do the same. My daily average on screen had increased to be 5 hours and my neck was starting to resent it. The current application is still under development, and the current stage mainly tests the integrity of the interface and the correctness of logical operations. If you encounter problems during development, please contact me.
